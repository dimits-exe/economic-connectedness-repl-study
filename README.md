  # Replication Study for Social Capital II: determinants of economic connectedness
  
  This project attempts to replicate and verify the results and findings of the recent paper 
  [Social capital II: determinants of economic connectedness](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04997-3) using the provided
  datasets and methodology. 
  
  We recreate the data and graphs used to justify the paper's findings, while including concise descriptions of the ideas and methods
  used in the original paper.
  
  
  ## Running the project
  
  The project was developed using jupyter notebook. To run the notebook instance you need to have jupyter notebook 
  [installed](https://jupyter.org/install). You also need to have the matplotlib, pandas, numpy, plotly and seaborn python libraries installed.
  
  Our datasets are taken from the Social Capital, Opportunity Atlas, and the 2018 American Community Survey (ACS)
  datasets. You can download a compiled version [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lM6a8ILg4-lhw8S-OnCnZBhePY0eLEqW?usp=sharing).
  The individual sources are listed in the notebook.
  
  To run the project, clone the repository or download it from Github, then navigate to the file's directory, download and place the datasets in a folder named "data" 
  inside the project directory and finally run `jupyter notebook "Economic Connectedness.ipynb"` in your terminal. 
  
  Alternatively, a pdf version is provided in this project. Note that due to incompatibilities between jupyter's converters and 
  pdf generators the format might be *unconventional* in some places.
